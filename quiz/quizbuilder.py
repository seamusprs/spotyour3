class Question:
    """
    A class for a question in the quiz game.

    The Question class allows for questions to be built based on the current playlist.
    It includes functions for fetching songs, checking the desired question type,
    and checking the validity of answers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    playlist : Playlist
        An instance of the 'Playlist' class that holds the playlist currently being quizzed on.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cur_question : str
        A string containing the question being asked of the user.
    cur_options : list of str
        A list of strings containing four possible solutions to the question (one correct).
    cur_solution :
        A string containing the correct answer to the question being asked.

    Methods
    -------
    getdata(num_song=4):
        Builds a list of songs randomly selected from the playlist, used as options when generating questions.
    makequestion(question_type : str):
        Takes the desired question type as an argument, calls the appropriate question type function,
        and returns the question information (question, options, and solution).
    checker(user_input, solution):
        Compares the user input answer to the correct solution and returns True if correct, false otherwise.
