### Project idea: Personalized Spotify Playlist Stats & Quiz: Spot your Spotify.

A package that contains two subpackages: stats and quiz. Stats allows users to gain insights about their Spotify playlist such as top artist, longest song, slowest song, etc. Quiz allows users to enter a game where they will be questioned on how well they know their playlist. The program will read a CSV file of the user playlist that users can obtain using Exportify.

**Package**: spotyourspotify
  - **Subpackage**: stats: contains all the code for parsing and analysing playlist

    - **Module**: `readdata`: for parsing the playlist
